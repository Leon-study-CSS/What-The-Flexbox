## My notes

Once you define a container as flex, all it's elements become flex items

### flex-direction
- sets the main axis
- row - the main axis is from left to right (default)
- column - the main axis is from top to bottom

the other axis is the cross axis

### flex-wrap 
the flex system tries to make the elements fit on the main axis, but it also stretches out in the container

### ordering
- the default of the orders is 0. with other numbers you can group them
- good for responsive designs
- selection of items (ex when you want to copy text) still follows the order in the html

### justify-content
how you align the items on the main axis

### align-items
how you align the items on the cross axis
- default is strech. take into account the size of the container
